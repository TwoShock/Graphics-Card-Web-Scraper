# Graphics-Card-Web-Scraper
<img src = "gpu.png" width = "50%" height = "50%">
This script scrapes graphics card prices on newegg.com and stores them in an excel file.

# Running the script
`conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`.  
<br />
This will create a new conda environment with name you gave it and install the requirments I used.
After this run the main file: `python main.py`<br /> An excel file will be generated with the updated graphics card information.
